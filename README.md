## 🛠️ How to Adapt for Yourself

1. **Replace personal info** — name, bio, and links in `index.html` and `about.html`
2. **Swap the photo** — replace `Pic.jpg` with your own image
3. **Update videos** — in `work.html`, change `data-url` and `data-videoid` attributes and thumbnail `src` for each video card
4. **Edit contacts** — update WhatsApp, Telegram, TikTok, and Instagram links
5. **Adjust colors** — all colors are defined as CSS variables in the `:root` block at the top of each file

## 🚀 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

1. Push your files to a GitHub repository
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**
3. Set source to `main` branch, `/ (root)` folder
4. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/`
